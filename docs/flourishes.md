# Flourish Docs

A flourish is a design patten used for creating ambient background elements to liven up pages and page components. Flourishes are a group of SVG elements (hatching patterns and polygons) that are controlled using CSS for styling and JavaScript for optional animation.

### Quick-start

To use an existing flourish group use the `flourish` partial inside the `content` partial block using either the `top` or `tail` postfix ie:

```handlebars
{{#content "flourish-top"}}
  {{> flourish flourish-top }}
{{/content}}
```

The argument passed to `flourish` partial is `flourish-top` markdown content (currently in YMAL format) ie:

```yaml
flourish-top:
  baseClass: flourish-group-a
  shapes:
  - shape: polygon-shape-4
    shapeClass: polygon-shape-4
    reveal: true
    exclude: bottom
  - shape: hatching-pattern-3
    shapeClass: hatching-pattern-3
    reveal: true
    exclude: bottom
```

Animation parameters will be randomly generated by the `reveal:true` setting. To switch off animation change to `false`. To reuse a flourish that has been configured for the opposite end (use a top at the footer), simply use the `flip: true` setting.

### Options

```yaml
# <div> Flourish level
baseClass: {string} - Class name for Flourish group to control group style
flip: {boolean} - Rotates a tail to be a top and vice versa

# <svg> Shape level
shape: {string} - The SVG shape to apply
shapeClass: {string} - Class name to control shape style
reveal: {boolean} - Animate into viewport on page scroll
exclude: {string} - Position property values to exclude from animation direction
```

### Animation

**reveal**

Using `reveal: true` will animate the flourish into position as scroll into viewport occurs using the ScrollReveall library. Each flourish will have randomly generated animation parameters. To check these settings see `scrollRevealModule.js`

**exclude**

The `top` `right` `bottom` `left` strings passed to `exclude` are to ensure the flourish animates in from off the page. An example of this is a top group only animating in from the top, right or left ie: `exclude: bottom`

**Note**: Animations are cannot be applied to SVG elements directly so we wrap them in a container element.

### Current implementation of flourishes in codebase

To better understand how these components function or before creating new flourishes it's worth understanding how the files link together in the codebase.

1.  `{page}.hbs` template calls the `flourish.hbs` partial in the inside a `#content` partial block.
2.  `flourish.hbs` partial consumes data from `pages.md`
3.  `flourish.hbs` partial also calls `flourishShapes` helper function passing through a `shape` label.
4.  `flourishShapes` helper function (a metalsmith gulp script) will return an SVG element which is a combination of shape data (called using the `shape` label) from `shapes.json` and a `presentation-svg.hbs` template.

### Creating new flourish groups

To create a new flourish group you will need to create a new unique group name and styling in `flourish-group.scss` using any combination of SVG shapes stored in `src/flourishes/shapes.json`

### Adding new flourishes

To add new SVG shapes you can simply extract the attribute values and add to `src/flourishes/shapes.json` and call as you would for any other flourish.

### Styling flourishes

Flourishes are absolutely positioned inside the group container. Each SVG is wrapped in a `div` which requires a width in absolute units (px) and position in relative units (%).

Rules that concern **size and scale** should be on the `div` that wraps each SVG shape while rules for **colour and gradients** should be on the SVG itself.

You can optionally apply the horizontal linear gradient (using a `fill` on the `.shape` class) with custom colours or transparency (using a `stop-color` on `.stop-1` and/or `.stop-2` classes) ie:

```css
.shape {
  fill: url("#hatching-pattern-2-gradient");
}
.stop-1 {
  stop-color: #fecb00; // yellow on the left
}
.stop-2 {
  stop-opacity: 0; // fade to transpartent on the right
}
```

**Do not apply** `transform` to the `div` that wraps each SVG shape as the ScrollReveal library inlines this rule to provide animation. If you require `transform` simply apply to the SVG directly.
