# Use of private information policy (GDPR)
Last updated: 24/05/2018


## Summary

We comply with the EU’s **General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)** and this policy explains how we collect and treat any information you give us. You won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. We’ve no desire to trick you into agreeing to something you might later regret.


## Why we value your privacy

We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to keeping your personal and business information safe. We’ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we’ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re required to by law.


## How we collect information

We only collect data through Google Analytics.

For the privacy policies regarding third party services, we refer you to their respective websites.


## What information we hold

We only collect basic information about your visit to our website, like what device are you using, how much time have you spent on it and which pages have you visited.


## Where we store your information

Our data is stored in Google Analytics and is kept there for 26 months.


## What we use your information for

We use those pieces of information to understand the user journey across our website. This is helpful to us for improving and adding new features.

## Who has access to information about you

The only time we will access information about you is if you apply for one of our available position. Your data is managed by a GDPR compliant third-party service and is only accessed by individuals involved with the hiring process.


## The steps we take to keep your information private

Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict access only to people who need it.
