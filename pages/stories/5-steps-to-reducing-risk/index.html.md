# 5 Steps to Reducing Risk

>The key to getting something done in 6 months, is to get a version of it done in 6 days, and expose it to the real world

Large enterprise organisations have always admired the approach and urgency of start-up’s. When you are stuck in the swamp of process and sign-offs the idea of emulating a start-up model seems particularly enticing. However this usually misses the point as accelerated delivery without customer validation, whilst it may meet internal metrics, is unlikely to lead to a successful digital service.

At Buildit we have been navigating this problem on how we can integrate a lean methodology to quickly uncover and validate assumptions for propositions within larger client projects. Through experimentation we have evolved and refined a methodology that’s designed to kick-start a digital project and reduce risk. Here are some of the components of that methodology…

1. **The Team**: The team should be small, co-creational and cross-functional. Design and technology working closely together with a strong product owner
2. **Time**: We deliberately keep this initial phase to around 7 weeks. In all our previous case studies we have found that this is the optimal time to evaluate the key assumptions and velocity is also essential for prioritisation and focus.
3. **Important and unknown assumptions**: There are usually so many unvalidated assumptions across a project team that one of the first steps should be to identify them collectively. Targeting the unknown and Important assumptions ensures the fundamental risks to success are analysed first. This set of tools has been developed and championed by Precoil CEO David Bland and it’s a great way of developing a shared team understanding of where the exploration and focus should be.
4. **Hypothesis led**: A Hypothesis asks a fundamental question that’s directly related to one or more of the assumptions. From this experiments are designed that can test and validate the hypothesis allowing the team to either iterate or pivot. For an experiment to have the best chance of success it should be designed in such a way that real data can be gathered from users. We have found, through experience, that building rapid prototypes in the target environment or technology accelerates learning and validation.
5. **The ecosystem**: Prototyping is not just about a front end experience. It’s also about customer journeys and technical architecture. Teams should not be afraid to bolt together a temporary ecosystem if it allows faster learning and data gathering

These are some of the fundamental components we have uncovered that support clients moving to a leaner process. For all these to be successful the client has to be an integral part of the team and hopefully they will become an advocate within the organisation for validation and reducing risk through these lean components.
