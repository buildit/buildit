description: Not sure what are you suppose to say during upcoming daily meeting? Are you going to brag or maybe confess? In Buildit @ Wipro Digital we created a little app to help answering such cumbersome questions. Not necessarily in a very serious manner.

We are proud to present the live version of our [Daily Routine](https://dailyroutine.buildit.digital/) app!

## Every story has a beginning

A few months ago, when coming back from a team meetup, we had an interesting conversation on the train: how to spot an underperforming team member?

One of the arguments was that in the era of **scrum** you have a **daily scrum** meeting that controls progress on the tasks and puts a solid dose of peer pressure on each team member.

Counterargument was that when you are working on a pathological project, you could easily play on a console or table football at the office all day long and **fake your status update** - scrum master wouldn't even notice if that is a true or a made-up **tech mumbo-jumbo**.

Maybe it's even possible to write a **simple app** that will throw out a status update that even engineers on the team won't be able to question.

Bragging? Underestimating scrum masters and project managers? Let's call a bluff! There was no other way to settle the argument than to run an experiment...

## Meet the Team

After releasing MVP, in one of the not-so-sunny August 2019 afternoons, we finally gathered everyone involved in the project in one room.

# Prototyping before coding

Before writing even one line of code we prepared [interactive prototype](https://wiprodigital.invisionapp.com/share/RXS7T0ME984#/screens) in InVision and gathered helpful feedback about overall user experience.

Another important part of pre-production process was defining potential users [proto-personas](https://github.com/BuildIt-Poland/daily-routine/blob/master/extras/daily-routine-proto-personas.pdf).

# Design driven delivery

Next step was setting up **backlog** in Jira and **project board** on the Gdańsk office's windows.

# It is just a beginning

After 2 months of hard work we finally released **MVP**. But we have a feeling it's just a beginning. [Don't shy away and contribute](https://github.com/BuildIt-Poland/daily-routine).
