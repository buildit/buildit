**Innovative** - self-confessed geeks, always curious to explore technology and better ways of working that deliver maximum business impact.

**Problem solvers** - we enjoy finding ways to make complicated tasks easy. We tackle root-causes, not symptoms. We are user-centric but keep an eye on the big picture.

**No "bull"** - from open-minded to open source, as natural collaborators, we are not afraid to 'do the right thing' for our clients and their customers.

**Battle tested** - resilience is our most valuable quality, with teams that own, commit and have the ability to adapt to unique organisational aspirations and challenges.


## What we do
We partner with our clients to solve hard problems, and help them deliver world-class products.We help them improve the way they solve business problems, ultimately changing the way they change.

> We are problem solvers who hone our craft through experimentation, continuous improvement and systems thinking.

True transformation only happens when change touches all areas of a company. We believe that change must be holistic and consider all aspects of the organisational stack, from recruitment to procurement, from operations to engineering, and from sales to support. We call this vertical transformation.

## How we do it
We are pragmatic partners who seek out the challenging work in all engagements, whether at enterprise scale or startup speed.

We are problem solvers who hone our craft through experimentation, continuous improvement and systems thinking

We approach each project and client as unique and we never start with a preconceived outcome or solution.

## Our people
buildit has an open structure, which means that employees work within wide boundaries.

The environment and culture, which is shaped by builditâ€™s people, is driven by several key factors including transparency, curiosity, inclusivity, pragmatism and responsibility. buildit employees work in an environment where everyone is encouraged to continually develop through a cohesive unit of learning, and perhaps more importantly, given the autonomy to do so.

We are part of the larger Wipro network and partner with [Wipro Digital](https://wiprodigital.com/) and [Designit](https://designit.com/).
