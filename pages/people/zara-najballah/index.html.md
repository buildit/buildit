Zara was one of the first to experience our parent companies London based graduate scheme before joining us at Buildit as a front end engineer and her story helped us strengthen the jump from pupil to programmer.

During an initial 6 week bootcamp to learn about how Buildit collaborates with our clients, Zara realised the open pathway and wide array of challenges involved with web development. Games programming at Kingston University gave a fundamental understanding of coding and computer science which was a great introduction into development, but, it left little room for any of the broad challenges coming from the internets rapid evolution.

> Stand-ups, retrospectives, peer-reviewing, pair-coding, and other agile activities like show and tells had become her bread and butter within a few short months

Shortly after completing the bootcamp she set to work on bugs and features on a live codebase whilst working client side as part of a team. Her mentor during this time helped her find the balance between picking up development tasks and contributing to the team. Stand-ups, retrospectives, peer-reviewing, pair-coding, and other agile activities like show and tells had become bread and butter within a few short months. Whilst this proved to be a valuable time, sponging up knowledge and becoming familiar with development processes she had a realisation that she had become a valuable team member, but, what was the team?

Zara quickly brought this up and touched on something we value highly. Buildit is a collective and we have the means to create our own culture. Our culture has the autonomy for people to decide how to get the best results for themselves which in turn benefits everyone. In order to benefit from this you need to be a part of that collective and Zara realised she was becoming more familiar with the ethos and culture of our client. A short while after mentioning this during her regular catch-ups with mentors she had completed her client objectives and joined us at Buildit HQ and set to work helping redevelop our company website. Working on an internal project offered an opportunity to not only engage with lots of other Buildsters but also be fostered into our culture. It wasn't long before Zara was contributing ideas and learning from a range of roles.

This proved to be an informative period. Developing with little restriction around peers with open but experienced opinions and contributing to a meaningful goal has become a north star the client work that has since followed. Something we're proud of here at Buildit is the environment where everyone wants to contribute and help improve what they personally value the most. Zara helped us tailor the graduate scheme to include more time in our culture and continue to help shape it.
