As a small team of Creative Technologists here at Buildit we thrive on rapidly making and breaking things to find the answers that improve products. Believing this should be done using any means, we can avoid derailing into detail and this enables us to tackle some of the broader problems. Combining design and technology by iterating and evaluating together we can cover the ground where the two intersect. This grey area is not always a very visible space making it problematic for planning in product teams. Bridging this gap involves asking questions and gathering information and a Creative Tech approach is no different. This can be daunting as teams converge to work it out, but, unlike separated disciplines Creative Tech can own it and take the burden away. Embracing this challenge, work can be delivered without falling victim to any misunderstood compromise.

An example of where Creative Tech has impacted a project was with a client struggling to complete before a looming deadline, already under pressure when we joined the team. Working alongside a fellow Creative Tech we asked for the outlined brief, followed by a conversation about where they currently were to understand why progress had slowed. All this was discovered in a single meeting.

We heard about how the client was building a browser based chatbot prototype as an assistant to a complex piece of software and how the different pieces of work weren’t quite linking together. We touched on some of the key areas for this evolving technology and put our knowledge forward to help scope what we could deliver and in doing so discovered that the criteria was unclear.

The following few days resulted in a number of activities to define requirements followed by solutions supported by simple tests. The results of our work were quickly played back to the client as we went along to avoid any big reveals at the end. Often the conversations worked two ways. We made frequent suggestions keeping up the interest and engagement from the client. This led to moments where they could feel more included and empowered with new knowledge on an emerging technology. Through these meetings we felt we could really help define the criteria and demonstrate how the chatbot would function using different tools:
- Flow diagram — A decision tree to visualise the conversation. While chatbots are dynamic by nature our MVP can primarily use short cut buttons (ie: yes or no).
- UI example — A single screen design to show the look and feel following brand guidelines.
- Working prototype — Built using Motion AI’s prototype tool that brought our idea to life and demonstrated common conventions which also proved valuable for accurate feedback.
- Language example — A small sample to demonstrate tone of voice and personality.
- Technology test — Our browser based product uses iframes which we tested upfront to know our ideas are compatible with the technology.
- Branded call to action — As a help tool we need to make sure the chatbot assistant is visible so users know it’s available without an introduction, but discrete enough to never be in the way by having it hidden behind a CTA on the software its supporting.

Our work covered UX, Design and Engineering and by the time we were handing over printouts and a prototype, we had a narrative to help build a picture and define the criteria. None of our work had deep dived and instead our work was spread out. The team was feeling less daunted not because we had provided deliverables but because our work provided a platform for making decisions on where to go next and an expectation on what it takes to get there.
