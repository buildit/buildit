We believe that change must be holistic and consider all aspects of the organisational stack, from recruitment to procurement, from operations to engineering, and from sales to support. We call this vertical transformation.</p><p>Read more about some of the <a href="https://medium.com/buildit/technology/home">technical challenges</a> we've faced, and our thoughts on <a href="https://medium.com/buildit/design-systems/home">Design Systems</a> on our Medium blog.</p>

This requires us to not only be able to do what "good looks like", but to stand in the middle of something not so good and positively influence the outcome day to day.</p><p>We enable learning behaviours through high psychological safety; we empower people through trust and autonomy.</p><p> Read more how we approach <a href="https://medium.com/buildit/org-change/home">organisational change</a> on our Medium blog.</p>
