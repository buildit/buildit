          h2 What drives you?
          p Do you think there’s something lacking in how many companies approach problems, whether it's people, process, or technology related?
          p Do you want to help them figure out how to think and work differently?
          p Do you love technology, and understand that real change comes from people and teams doing different things, rather than doing the same things differently?
          p These are the things that drive us.
            strong  Do they drive you?

          p Trust allows autonomy.
            strong  Autonomy rocks.
