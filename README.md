# Buildit

This is the buildit website.

To run it locally just `npm install` then run the `start` script: `npm start`. Local hosting is at http://localhost:8080 and a browser window should open automatically.

To build the static website: `npm run-script build`. Distribution goes into `./dist`

## Requirements

node v6.9 or higher is required.
