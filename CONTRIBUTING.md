# Contributing

We welcome all forms of contribution! Bugs reports and feedback can be just as valuable as code contributions!

Please direct all bug reports, feature requests or other feedback to our [Buildit website feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOeoF7XfYYs3R8b9K_zvSY0oVS92hAV82FXUOyy8JnDz2lNg/viewform). This allows the Buildit website maintainers to effectively review, triage and prioritise any incoming work. Whatever the outcome of your feedback is, we aim to respond to you with an update.

If you want to make code contributions, please follow the process outlined below. Whether you have a specific fix or feature in mind already, or if you have spare time and just want to help out - we'd love to hear from you!


## Code contributions

### Process

To avoid wasted effort, please always follow this process:

1. **Reach out to the [Buildit website maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/buildit/teams/buildit-website-maintainers)** to discuss what you want to do.
    * This helps avoid duplicate work - someone else might already be working on the same thing you were going to do!
    * The maintainers can also help you determine how best to architect your contribution
1. **Create a feature branch**
    * As per our [branching strategy](./docs/branching-strategy.md)
1. **Write your code**
    * Make sure you follow all the relevant conventions (see next section)
1. **[Create a pull request](https://github.com/buildit/buildit/pulls)** once your code is ready
    * The maintainers will then review your code and, if necessary, request changes
    * Once approved, your PR will be merged and the associated feature branch will be deleted.


### Code conventions and other important info

Before diving into the code, please familiarise yourself with the following:

* Our [coding standards](./docs/coding-standards.md)
* Our [branching strategy](./docs/branching-strategy.md)
* Our [build process](./docs/build-process.md)
* [Testing](./docs/tests.md)

Any code contributions that do not follow these conventions will be rejected!
